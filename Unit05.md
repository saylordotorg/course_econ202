**Unit 5: Monetary Policy** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will teach you how economists think about money.  For
economists, money is something that produces money services—in other
words, any commodity, document, token, or claim that can be used as a
medium of exchange and that people demand for that purpose.  If the
value of a given asset rises because people demand its services, we call
that asset “money” or “money assets.” Over time, as different demands
for money services arise, new instruments emerge to supply those
services.  This unit looks at the different motives for demanding money
and different forms used to supply the demand. We also explore the role
of institutions in regulating money.*
