**Unit 3: Consumption, Savings, Capital and Investment** <span

*Households are generally defined as the owners of all factors of
production in an economy.  Since households provide the factor services
of labor, land, capital, and ownership to businesses, they receive
payment in the form of wages, rent, interest, and profits.  When we talk
about “household behavior” in this unit, we mean the decisions that
households make in various contexts—such as decisions concerning
consumption, savings, investments in education and training.*  
    
 *“Firm behavior” is primarily concerned with boosting efficiency and
productivity in the production of goods and services.  The firm’s
decision-making processes center upon technology, entrepreneurship,
innovation, employment relations, outsourcing, and competition policy. 
The interplay of decisions between households and firms is critical to
maintaining a flow of goods, services, and incomes in a complex
economy.  This unit focuses on the decisions made by households and
firms, the factors the influence those decisions (such as the trade
balance, and interest rates faced by firms), and their effects on the
macroeconomy.*  
    
 *Most of us are familiar with the interest paid on deposits or the
interest paid on a mortgage.  This unit will discuss this concept in
macroeconomic terms.  It will explain that individuals and firms need
money in the present in order to operate, so when money is borrowed for
use, a payment is made for its use over a period of time.  We call these
payments interest rates.  As with the price of anything, if demand
increases for the use of money, then its price (the interest rate) also
rises.*
