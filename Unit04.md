**Unit 4: Fiscal Policy** <span id="4"></span> 
*Fiscal policy describes the government’s spending and taxing
decisions.  The economic objective of government is to maximize social
well-being while operating within a budget. The government’s role in the
economy is complex, and economic models attempt to account for the
far-reaching effects of policy decisions.  Simple one-period or static
models lay the foundation for analyzing short-term effects of taxing and
spending decisions.  Dynamic multiperiod models are then constructed to
better explain the ripple effects of government policies.*  
    
 *Every government faces the choice to either raise revenue through
taxes or borrow funds by issuing bonds.  There is no one correct
decision, and tradeoffs must be considered.  A well-thought-out policy
will incorporate external factors like the current business cycle,
international developments, and demographic changes.  For example,
increased taxation tends to slow economic activity yet limits the amount
of debt.  Aside from economic considerations, optimal tax and borrowing
policies must factor in the political process.  A final policy is a
compromise among many stakeholders, and good fiscal policy analysis is
framed by political forces. *
