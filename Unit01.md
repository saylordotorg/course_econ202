**Unit 1: Gross Domestic Product & Decisions Under Uncertainty** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the main measure economists use to
explain how much an economy produces at any given time.  Over time,
trends can be identified and patterns of growth and contraction can be
seen.  Inflation, or the general rise of prices, affects how GDP is
measured, and economists have to account for variations in measurement
tools and approaches.  No one measurement system or technique is most
accurate all of the time.  Different schools of thought consider how to
calculate and interpret GDP from their own perspectives.*  
 *             
 Decisions are often made with incomplete knowledge under shifting
economic, political, and social conditions.  Determining how best to
estimate and compensate for uncertainty is a complex process;
macroeconomists use mathematical techniques to approximate real-world
choices and outcomes.  Decisions under uncertainty draw on a variety of
techniques, including game theory, statistical analysis, and calculus.
