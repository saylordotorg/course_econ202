**Unit 2: Output, Employment, and Unemployment** <span id="2"></span> 
*Individuals must make a choice between spending their time working or
pursuing other activities like raising a family, leisure, or enhancing
health and wellness.  When individuals offer their services for work,
they receive a wage in exchange for giving up alternative choices. 
Commensurate with the individual’s choice, firms must also demand labor
for an employment market to exist.  When the wage individuals demand
equals the wage offered by firms, equilibrium exists.*  
    
 *The government is very active in most labor arrangements.  Aside from
regulating the work environment, government typically provides minimum
guarantees of wage, unemployment insurance, and a system of income in
retirement.  Macroeconomists have various ways of modeling the trends,
effects, and causes of unemployment.  Sustained high levels of
unemployment may lead to societal difficulties. *
